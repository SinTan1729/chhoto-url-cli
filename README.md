# Chhoto URL CLI
This is a companion CLI tool for [Chhoto URL](https://github.com/SinTan1729/chhoto-url). It provides simple commands for interacting with
a Chhoto URL server.

All the functions of this tool can be replicated using `curl`, but this is supposed to be easier to use. The server needs to have an API key
in order to be accessible using this CLI tool.

# Notes
- This was just a learning project for me. I wanted to write something tangible using Golang. So, don't expect this to be maintained in the future.
- I haven't used any external packages, everything is written in pure Go, using the Go Standard Library. I'll try to keep it this way.
