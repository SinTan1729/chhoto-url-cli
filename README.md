# Chhoto URL CLI
This is a companion CLI tool for [Chhoto URL](https://github.com/SinTan1729/chhoto-url). It provides simple commands for interacting with
a Chhoto URL server.

All the functions of this tool can be replicated using `curl`, but this is supposed to be easier to use. The server needs to have an API key
in order to be accessible using this CLI tool.
